# Flashcard-App

This is a flashcard application that allows users to study online. It allows the creation and deletion of decks and cards and allows users to study existing cards.

This project was developed as an assignment for the Thinkful.com software engineering course. It was developed using React.js and Bootstrap 4.

The home screen looks like the image below. In this case an example deck is shown, however, when initially using the app, no decks would be shown before the user creates one.

As you can see, when a deck does exist, it is shown on this screen with the title, a description, and "study", "view", and "delete" buttons.

The study screen looks like this:

On this screen, each card is shown front-side first with a "flip" button that, when clicked, reveals the other side of the card. After a card is flipped, a "next" button is shown which allows the user to move on to the next card in the deck.

A deck must have at least three cards to be studied.

When the last card is viewed, the user can either restart the deck or be redirected to the home screen.

The create deck screen looks like this:

When submitted, the user is redirected to the screen of the newly created deck. If the user cancels, they are redirected back to the home screen.

The deck screen looks like this:

![Deck Screen](https://res.cloudinary.com/strive/image/upload/w_1000,h_1000,c_limit/f63b8bedaaf37cd8c3245febe6f0275f-deck.png)

On this screen, the user has the option to edit or delete individual cards or the deck as a whole. 

The new card screen looks like this:

![New Card Screen](https://res.cloudinary.com/strive/image/upload/w_1000,h_1000,c_limit/fcc7dde129ed17b6ee199313e1dbc542-card-add.png)

The save button on this screen would add the card to the deck and the new card process would be restarted with blank fields.
The done button redirects the user to the deck screen.
